            <p class="lead">Since the company was founded in 1983, Briem Engineering has undergone steady, controlled growth. This growth has been achieved largely through repeat and referral business. We're proud of our reputation for producing sound technical results at a reasonable cost to our clients.</p>
            <p class="lead">As a result of this growth, the company designed and built a new laboratory facility in the St. Louis area. The new building was designed specifically for our needs and with space to allow for future, anticipated growth.</p>
            <p class="lead">The major strength of the company is, of course, our personnel. Briem Engineering associates have degrees in Metallurgy, Materials Engineering, Structural Engineering and Chemistry.</p>
            <p class="lead">It is anticipated that, through the continued ability of our staff and continued customer satisfaction, the company will continue to progress and provide a greater contribution to the technical community.</p>
